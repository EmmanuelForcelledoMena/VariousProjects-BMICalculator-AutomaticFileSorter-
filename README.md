# README

This repository is dedicated to small projects. While their size might not make them suitable for inclusion in a single repository, they remain equally interesting and valuable on their own. Below are the details of the projects included:

## Automatic File Sorter in File Explorer.py

The script (`Automatic File Sorter in File Explorer.py`) organizes all files in folders according to their format. It is fully automated, allowing you to run it in the background if desired.

## Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator.py

The script (`Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator.py`) is a body mass index calculator. As the name suggests, it calculates your BMI based on your measurements, allowing you to choose between the English or Metric measurement systems.

Feel free to explore each project individually, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for your interest in my small projects repository!
